# This is the autoconf script for the sample dispatch library, which
# allows netCDF to read files of a user-defined format. In the case of
# this sample project, HDF4 is the format. There is no need for this
# library to be used operationally, as netCDF already includes the
# capability to read HDF4. This is a sample of how to create a
# dispatch library for netCDF's user-defined format feature.
